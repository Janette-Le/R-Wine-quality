<p align="justify">Wine (from Latin vinum) is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes, fermented without the addition of sugars/acids/enzymes/water/other nutrients, with a history lasting for thousands of years and is closely related to the history of agriculture, cuisine, civilization, and humanity. 
After thousands of years of wine production, improvements in the winemaking process and exploration of various unique types of grapes as a raw ingredient, nowadays, there is significant diversity in wine industry with almost 200 types of wine by taste and style, classified into 5 main types: white, red, rosé, sparkling and fortified wine. For this project, I choose red version of Vinho Verde Wine to analyze, which has incredibly deep in color, a youthful, inky purple,  made principally from the late-ripening, red-fleshed Vinhão grape.<br>
The taste of wine depends on various elements, and is strongly related to 11 typical independent chemicals in red wine do affect its quality and to what extent. In another way, we use machine learning to determine which physicochemical properties make a wine “good”!</p>
